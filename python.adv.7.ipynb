    "The purpose of the try statement in Python is to define a block of code where exceptions can occur. It is used to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code within the try block.\n",

    "\n",
    "The code within the try block is executed.\n",
    "If an exception occurs within the try block, the execution is immediately transferred to the appropriate except block that matches the type of the raised exception. The first matching except block is executed, and then the program continues executing from the point immediately after the entire try-except statement.\n",
    "If no exception occurs within the try block, the else block (if present) is executed. This block is optional and is executed only if no exception is raised.\n",
    "The finally block (if present) is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used to specify cleanup code that should be executed, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "The try statement allows you to handle exceptions gracefully by providing specific code blocks to handle different types of exceptions. It helps in maintaining the control flow of the program even when errors occur, enabling you to handle exceptional conditions and ensure proper execution of your code."

If the expression is True, the assert statement does nothing and the program continues its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assert statement is primarily used as a debugging aid to check for conditions that should always be true during the execution of a program. It helps to identify and catch logical errors or inconsistencies in the code. By using assertions, you can verify assumptions and ensure that the program state is as expected at specific points in the code.\n",

The assert statement is used for testing conditions and raising an AssertionError exception if the condition fails.
